# Solar Quoting Tool

This is an iOS app I made for my mobile applications development final project. It is a basic calculator where the user can input values about their desired project and receive back a quote estimate to have solar installed on their home. The app also allows you to share your quote via email, iMessage, social media, etc and then takes the user to a Contact Us page for next steps with the solar company (my dad's business SolX).
